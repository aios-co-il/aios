 * Tabs that fetch their own data (not from this list) include:
 * - connections → useClientConnections
 * - credentials → client_credentials
 * - meeting emails (extra contacts) → client_contacts
 * - docs linked chat files → team_chat_files
 * - recordings / tables / dashboards / wordpress / updates → per-tab queries
